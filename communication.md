# Communication Unwritten Rules

## Overview
Effective communication is crucial for team success. These guidelines help maintain clarity, respect, and productivity in our interactions.

## Core Principles

### 1. Default to Transparency
- Share progress regularly, even if incomplete
- Communicate blockers early
- Document decisions publicly
- No surprises in retrospectives

### 2. Assume Positive Intent
- Start with curiosity, not criticism
- Ask clarifying questions before making assumptions
- Give benefit of the doubt in written communication
- Remember we're all working toward the same goals

### 3. Be Direct but Kind
- Provide honest feedback constructively
- Address issues promptly and privately first
- Praise publicly, critique privately
- Use "I" statements when expressing concerns

## Communication Channels

### Slack Guidelines

#### Channel Usage
| Channel | Purpose | Response Time |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| #general | Company-wide announcements | No response expected |
| #dev-team | Development discussions | 2-4 hours |
| #urgent | Critical issues | 15 minutes |
| #random | Non-work discussions | Optional |
| #help | Technical questions | 1-2 hours |

#### Slack Etiquette
- **Use threads** for detailed discussions
- **@here** only for time-sensitive team matters
- **@channel** only for critical urgent issues
- **DMs** for private or sensitive topics
- **Status updates** when away or focused

#### Message Formatting
```
✅ Good: "Hey team, I'm blocked on the API integration. Error details in thread. Any ideas?"
❌ Bad: "Nothing works!!!"

✅ Good: "@john Can you review PR #123 when you have time today?"
❌ Bad: "review pls"
```

### Meeting Etiquette

#### Before the Meeting
- Send agenda 24 hours in advance
- Include meeting goals and expected outcomes
- Share relevant documents beforehand
- Test tech setup for virtual meetings

#### During the Meeting
- **Start on time** - Respect everyone's schedule
- **Stay on mute** when not speaking (virtual)
- **One conversation** at a time
- **Take notes** - Rotate note-taking responsibility
- **Park off-topic items** for later discussion

#### After the Meeting
- Share notes within 24 hours
- Clear action items with owners and deadlines
- Follow up on commitments
- Cancel if no agenda or quorum

### Async Communication

#### Best Practices
- **Over-communicate context** - Others lack your background
- **Use bullet points** for clarity
- **Include timezones** when scheduling
- **Set expectations** for response times
- **Use recordings** for complex explanations

#### Documentation First
- Write it down before asking
- Update docs after solving problems
- Link to documentation in discussions
- Create FAQs for repeated questions

## Response Time Expectations

### Working Hours
- Core hours: 10 AM - 4 PM (local timezone)
- Flexible start/end times communicated to team
- Response within same business day expected
- After-hours communication not expected

### By Communication Type
| Type | Expected Response |
|------|------------------|
| Urgent/Blocking | 15-30 minutes |
| PR Review Request | 24 hours |
| General Questions | 4 hours |
| FYI/Updates | No response needed |
| Email | 48 hours |

## Conflict Resolution

### Escalation Path
1. **Direct conversation** - Try to resolve 1:1
2. **Include mediator** - Bring in neutral party
3. **Team lead involvement** - Escalate if needed
4. **HR involvement** - For serious issues

### Healthy Debate Guidelines
- Focus on ideas, not persons
- Use data to support arguments
- Acknowledge valid opposing points
- Agree to disagree when necessary
- Document decisions and rationale

## Remote Communication

### Video Call Best Practices
- **Camera on** for team meetings (when possible)
- **Good lighting** and audio quality
- **Minimize background noise**
- **Be present** - Avoid multitasking
- **Record** important sessions

### Time Zone Awareness
- Include timezone in meeting invites
- Rotate meeting times for fairness
- Use async methods when possible
- Record meetings for those who can't attend
- Be mindful of others' working hours

## Feedback Culture

### Giving Feedback
- Be specific and actionable
- Balance positive and constructive
- Timely - Don't wait for reviews
- Focus on behavior, not personality
- Offer help and resources

### Receiving Feedback
- Listen without defending
- Ask clarifying questions
- Thank the person
- Reflect before responding
- Follow up on improvements

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do's
✅ Acknowledge messages even if you can't respond fully
✅ Update tickets/issues with progress
✅ Celebrate wins and learn from failures
✅ Ask questions - No question is stupid
✅ Respect focus time and deep work blocks
✅ Use inclusive language
✅ Proofread before sending

### Don'ts
❌ Ghost on conversations
❌ Make assumptions about availability
❌ Use ALL CAPS (seen as shouting)
❌ Discuss personnel issues publicly
❌ Forward emails without permission
❌ Schedule meetings without agenda
❌ Interrupt or talk over others

## Cultural Considerations
- Be aware of cultural holidays
- Respect different communication styles
- Avoid idioms that don't translate
- Be patient with non-native speakers
- Learn about teammates' backgrounds

## Emergency Communication
For production issues or emergencies:
1. Post in #urgent with @here
2. Include: What's broken, Impact, What you've tried
3. Page on-call if no response in 15 minutes
4. Update thread with progress
5. Post resolution and postmortem link

## Remember
- Written communication lacks tone - be extra clear
- When in doubt, over-communicate
- Kindness and respect cost nothing
- We're all human - mistakes happen
- Building trust takes time, losing it takes seconds
